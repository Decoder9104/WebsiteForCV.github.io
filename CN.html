            <p class="First">
                I would like to work as a technology development apprentice as I believe this is the most effective path to utilize and improve my programming skills. The idea of a world ran by computers is very compelling, therefore, by using programming I can become one of the people who implement the digital world to create mind-blowing applications which will become part of the ever-growing computing industry. In this decade, AI will be used a lot for making quick and convenient code, which may be at a disadvantage for a lot of new junior software developers, so gaining vast amount of knowledge and skills earlier will be more helpful if I move towards an apprenticeship.

                My interest in coding stems from doing C# in college and in that time, I learnt and began to love decomposition of code and solving various other complex tasks. Now, I have taken an interest in learning more programming languages and this apprenticeship will act as a bridge towards completing this newfound goal I have attained. Furthermore, the theory surrounding software development is very fascinating as it will be taught by professional software developers who will help accelerate my learning developing good coding from the start. By extension, this apprenticeship can help develop soft skills like communication proving articulate speech, problem solving, teamwork, time management and many more. These skills will be essential in the near future and serve me in the long run to becoming an amazing software developer

                Taking an apprenticeship will deem more worthful in increasing my knowledge of software development and will allow me to portray exceptional number of skills whilst gaining real world experience. One to One real world experience can provide the ability to excel at many different problems with ease compared to going University. The ideology of earn while you learn is very compelling to me as it’ll provide amazing skills and by extension financial stability.

                This apprenticeship is my way forward to become a professional software developer. The software industry is very competitive due to the vast number of people who take interest in it, and because of this I wish to become the best of them. The competitive nature stimulates me to try harder than other developers allowing me to achieve the best results. The industry is rapidly evolving so I will be able to adapt to these changes as they emerge, which will give me the upper hand. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Software development can have a one-to-many relationship with domains, from app development to artificial intelligence and more. I want to learn and be part of an organisation which will help make exceptional applications for the public. This network of professionals and fellow apprentice can be valuable in the future providing collaborations and perhaps more job opportunities. Learning from professionals can give me an insight into the growing industry boosting my growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Completing a software development apprenticeship can jumpstart my career as I’ll gain practical experience and improve my portfolio once my apprenticeship is over. A strong portfolio can act as a powerful asset in the job market increasing my chances of getting hired as it’ll be more attractive to employers. Furthermore, software development jobs are in demand all over the world which means that I can explore job opportunities in various countries.
